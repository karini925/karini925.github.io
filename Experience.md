## Experience

---

### Computational Biologist
**[Pioneer Labs](https://www.pioneer-labs.org/#mission)** &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; 2025 – present

Computational biology research at the intersection of genomics, machine learning, and systems biology.

---

### PhD, Systems Biology
**[Knowles Lab](https://daklab.github.io/), Columbia University** &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; 2021 – 2025

Developed computational methods for studying RNA splicing heterogeneity in single-cell data.
