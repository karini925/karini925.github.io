# Lymphoma research 

From May 2019 to July 2021, I worked in [Dr. Robert Kridel's](http://kridel-lab.ca/) lab at [UHN](https://www.uhnresearch.ca/institutes/pm), Toronto. There, I contributed to several manuscripts focused primarily on functional genomics research in Lymphoma. For example, I created a [shiny based website](https://lymphoma.shinyapps.io/NHL-ASCT-PI/) to visualize a patient risk model that combines the PET-CT scan based Deauville score and other clinical risk factors.

# Course projects @ Columbia PhD program 

Here are some class projects that I have worked on so far: 

### Predicting COVID-19 RNA-protein interactions
